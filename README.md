### Hello! 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m foopsss, though my real name is Lucas.
- 🌱 I'm currently maintaining a few repos to store things like my Linux dotfiles, ebuilds for Gentoo Linux, spec files for Fedora Linux and more. I also have a repo with scripts I made for Linux and Windows.
- 💞️ I welcome anyone who wants to collaborate!
<!---
foopsss/foopsss is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
