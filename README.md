### Hello! 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m foopsss, although my real name is Lucas Ivan Benchat Parra. I'm a Systems Engineering student from Argentina.
- 🌱 I'm currently maintaining a few repos to store things like my Linux dotfiles, ebuilds for Gentoo Linux, spec files for Fedora Linux, scripts made for Linux and Windows, and more. I'm also learning Rust at the moment.
- 💞️ I welcome anyone who wants to collaborate!

foopsss/foopsss is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
